# Multidimensional-Spatial-Index
The utimate Spatial Index Model that can be extended by any spatial index system in any multidimensional space (with discrete or connected dimensions). 
The model will provide basic spatial queries for all possible tessellation methods, given the definition of distance and adjacency. 

MSI will support the query of the data archive of APOLLO, the subordinate function of GAIA.
